------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Project Structure
* vim.h:
	- Header file for project

* driver.cpp:
	- Contains main method
	- Creates and deletes a single VolImage object
	- Handles using console input to perform expected operations on VolImage object

* VolImage.cpp
	- Class for volumetric image manipulation objects
	- Contains all methods required to perform expected operations (as stipulated by Assignment outline)
	- Handles file I/O as well as handling (allocation and deletion) of pointers

2. Running Project
	1) Direct terminal to directory containing project files (driver.cpp, VolImage.cpp & vim.h)
	2) Run command: volimage <imageBase> [-d i j output_file_name] [-x i output_file_name]
	(where <imageBase> is the prefix for the file sequence).
	2.1) Optional: -d i j output_file_name: compute a difference map between images i and j, and write this out to file.
	2.2) Optional: -x i output file name: extract and write the slice with number i and write this out to file.
	2.3) NB: only one of [-d|-x] commands can be done at one time.
	2.4) NB: relative paths must be provided for files
